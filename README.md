# Custom Mechanical Keyboard + DIY Ball Mouse  
### Built Raspberry Pi Pico

This is a fully functional 75% mechanical keyboard and custom ball-style mouse, built entirely from scratch using PVC pipes, recycled hardware, and a Raspberry Pi Pico running [KMK](https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware). It supports layers, macros, mouse emulation, a physical scroll wheel, and multimedia controls. The custom mouse is inspired by Pimoroni's ball mouse, utilizing the sensor from an old mouse and a homemade housing.
